		<h2>About Naruto</h2>

		<p>Naruto is a hotheaded ninja who's all too ready to brag about his prowess or pick a fight with anyone who might be his superior. He developed this trait after years of alienation as a way to prove to everyone that they are wrong about him. It is his goal to become Hokage, the ninja champion of the Fire nation. He strongly believes in the inherent goodness of people, even when it seems hopeless. His own hard life giving him the ability to empathise with others.</p>
